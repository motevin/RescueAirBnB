# RescueAirBnB
In the aftermath of the 2017 Kenyan elections, many have been left displaced or placed in harm's way. The Kenya National Human Rights Commission (KNHRC) estimates that about 24 people have lost their lives due to violence in the 24 hours following the announcement of the presidential results. 
‘RescueBnB’ is an initiative started by @Nyawira to link Kenyans displaced by localized violence in areas around Nairobi and Kisumu with willing volunteer hosts.
